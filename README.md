# CS313E-Project

# What is your project idea about?

The objective of this project is to develop a system that assists in the selection of materials for structural components based on specific criteria, such as strength and density.

# If you use any datasets, describe the dataset and provide how one can access and download it.

Utilized a comprehensive material properties database that includes information such as tensile strength, density, Brinell Hardness Number, etc., for various materials like metals, polymers, and composites.
The dataset can be downloaded from kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/purushottamnawale/materials

# Describe your design for main packages, classes, methods, functions, and iterations between them.

# Describe any libraries that you use.

# Design some Test cases that can test the correctness of your software.

# What is your current expectations of your software? For example, do you expect that it works well?

# What are the expected weaknesses?
